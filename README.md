## 👋 What is this?

We love traveling and cooking meals with family and friends, only to find a single dull IKEA knife and a scratched-up Teflon pan in your rental.

We're building a system to ship professional-grade cooking gear directly to rentals, so you don't have to lug a bag of kitchen tools or run to Target just to make a decent meal.

## 🛑 The Problem

If you've stayed in a short term rental you know the struggle:
* Inventory the kitchen on arrival only to find six ladels, 14 wine screws and not a single bread knife.
* The knives are dangerously dull.
* The pans are warped or peeling.
* You spend half your vacation trying to figure out if they own a can-opener.

 **Pack your own gear** :rage: or **deal with it** :disappointed:.

## ⚡ The Experiment

We're testing a vacation kitchen kit for the people who cook.

**Current Alpha Build**
* 📦 **The Box:** Lockable, shippable, indestructible.
* 🔪 **The Steel:** Professional knives (Chef, Serrated, Paring).
* 🍳 **The Pan:**  Premium nonstick fry pan
* 🧼 **The Promise:** It shows up clean, sharp, and ready to go.
